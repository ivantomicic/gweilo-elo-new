You are working on a production web app with strict architectural rules.
Follow these rules at all times unless explicitly told otherwise.

GENERAL CODING RULES

-   Prefer simple, explicit code over abstractions
-   Avoid premature optimization
-   Avoid unnecessary indirection
-   Document assumptions in comments instead of asking questions

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

-   React components: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`)
-   Utility/helper files: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `apiClient.ts`)
-   Type/interface files: camelCase with `.types.ts` suffix (e.g., `user.types.ts`)
-   Constants files: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or camelCase (e.g., `constants.ts` or `API_CONSTANTS.ts`)
-   Next.js pages/routes: lowercase (App Router convention, e.g., `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`)
-   API routes: lowercase (e.g., `route.ts`, `api/users/route.ts`)
-   Test files: Same as source file with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix (e.g., `Button.test.tsx`)

FAILURE MODE
If any rule conflicts with a suggestion:

-   Follow these rules
-   Explain the tradeoff briefly in comments

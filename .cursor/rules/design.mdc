# DESIGN & UX RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Color & Theme

-   Dark mode ONLY.
-   Do not introduce light mode tokens, themes, or conditional logic.
-   Use high-contrast text for readability in indoor/low-light environments.
-   Avoid pure black backgrounds; prefer near-black for eye comfort.
-   Accent colors should be used sparingly to highlight:
    -   Active matches
    -   Elo gains/losses
    -   Rankings and podium positions

## Typography

-   Prefer large, readable font sizes.
-   Numbers (scores, Elo) must be visually prominent.
-   Avoid decorative fonts.
-   Hierarchy must be obvious without relying on color alone.

## Layout Principles

-   Mobile-first: design for one-handed use.
-   Critical actions must be reachable by thumb.
-   Avoid deep nesting and hidden interactions.
-   Use cards and tables for structured data.
-   Prefer vertical stacking over horizontal scrolling on mobile.

## Navigation

-   Mobile must use a floating bottom navigation bar.
-   Navigation items should be limited (4–5 max).
-   Current route must be visually obvious.
-   Avoid hamburger menus for primary navigation.

## Live Session UX (Highest Priority Screen)

-   Support multiple matches visible at once.
-   Match cards must be compact and scannable.
-   Do NOT require per-match confirmation actions.
-   Results are entered in bulk per session part.
-   Provide clear visual separation between session parts.
-   Always show:
    -   Current session part
    -   Progress indicator (dots or steps)

## Data Density & Feedback

-   This is a sports app, not a lifestyle app.
-   Show rankings, tables, and comparisons by default.
-   Animations must communicate state change (Elo change, match completion).
-   Avoid decorative animations that slow interaction.

## Buttons & Inputs

-   Touch targets must be large enough for fast tapping.
-   Avoid small icon-only buttons without labels.
-   Inputs for scores should:
    -   Be numeric
    -   Avoid free-text where possible
    -   Prevent invalid states visually

## Animations & Motion

-   Use subtle motion to indicate:
    -   State changes
    -   Navigation transitions
    -   Score updates
-   Prefer animation-ui or magicui primitives.
-   Never block interaction with animations.

## Component Usage Rules

-   Do NOT import shadcn, magicui, or animate-ui directly in feature code.
-   All UI primitives must go through `components/ui` wrappers.
-   Components should be reusable and domain-agnostic.
-   Domain logic must not leak into UI primitives.

## Accessibility (Pragmatic)

-   Text must meet contrast requirements in dark mode.
-   Interactive elements must be clearly distinguishable.
-   Do not rely on color alone to communicate win/loss.

## Failure Mode

If a design decision conflicts with:

-   speed
-   clarity
-   rankings visibility

Then choose the option that improves **competitive clarity**.

Document tradeoffs briefly in comments.

UI / COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE (VERY IMPORTANT)

- shadcn/ui, animate-ui, and magicui components must NEVER be imported directly in feature or page code.
- ALL third-party UI components must be wrapped in our own components first.

Required structure:
components/
ui/ // our public design-system API (wrappers only)
vendor/ // third-party implementations (shadcn, magicui, animate-ui)

Example rule:

- Feature code may import ONLY from `components/ui`
- `components/ui` may import from `components/vendor`
- Direct imports from shadcn, magicui, animate-ui outside `components/ui` are forbidden.

If a new UI primitive is needed:

1. Create a wrapper in `components/ui`
2. Implement it using shadcn / magicui / animate-ui in `components/vendor`
3. Use ONLY the wrapper in the app

RATIONALE:

- UI libraries must be replaceable in the future
- shadcn is an implementation detail, not the app API
